                    <div class="text marginSetting">The Builders Association is an OBIE-award winning performance and media company based in New York City. For over 20 years, the Builders have been at the forefront of the integration of advanced technology and media with live performance. Innovative collaborations are at the heart of Builders productions, which combine media, architecture, light and sound with live performers into an integrated performance aesthetic which has become our signature. The Builders' focus on "real world" stories as content for our productions -- digging into subjects as diverse as Indian call centers, dataveillance, and the recent global economic crisis.  We tell these stories through the lens of technology in order to creatively represent the economic, political, and technological forces, which affect us daily -- to make the invisible visible through the creative potential of multimedia theater. </div>

                <div class="text marginSetting" style="margin-top:10px;">this session begins with a brief history and conversation about the work of OBIE-award winning performance and media company The Builders Association, and introduces participating students to the company's unique real-time multimedia devising process by staging a brief 'open rehearsal'.  Small groups then go through a series of exercises using media and collaborating on sketches which are used as a springboard for further group development and discussion.</div>

                <div class="text marginSetting" style="margin-top:10px;">Following brief presentations of the participants’ work, we will examine a Builders production to unpack the idea of "mediaturgy" – not simply how to incorporate media, but the justifications of why this choice is made and its repercussions in a larger context of live performance. Through a series of discussions and group exercises, we will delineate ways in which deploying media influences content, and how disparate elements can be joined to create dramaturgically complex multimedia events.</div>

                <div class="text marginSetting" style="margin-top:10px;">We will present and discuss various interactive media tools available to performance-makers such as Isadora, Max/Jitter, Watch Out and Ableton, and stage some basic uses of these tools. Participants will be challenged to work in short scenes with a variety of software, reflecting on the effects and possibilities of each variation.</div>

                <div class="text marginSetting" style="margin-top:5%;font-size:20px;">A final discussion will sum up the work the participants have proposed, and look ahead to discuss live performance in an increasingly mediatized culture.  What does ‘liveness’ have to offer on the stage, online, and in other participatory sites?  How can we, as artists, remain focused on the basic values of storytelling in theater?  We will conclude with reflections on the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience.  </div>
